The open62541 has now a new modern website. The website is built with the HUGO Framework (https://gohugo.io/) and the content is therefore completely written in markdown. The website is public visible in our open62541-www repository. The deploy process of the new webpage is automated by a github action. During the deploy phase the markdown files are compiled with the hugo tools to a static website.

* New responsive design
* Secure static website
* Publicly visible in the open62541-www repository
